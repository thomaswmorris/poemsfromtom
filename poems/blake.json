I fear that I am not like thee:\n      For I walk through the vales of Har, and smell the sweetest flowers:\n      But I feed not the little flowers: I hear the warbling birds,\n      But I feed not the warbling birds, they fly and seek their food:\n      But Thel delights in these no more because I fade away\n      And all shall say, without a use this shining women liv'd,\n      Or did she only live to be at death the food of worms.\n\n      The Cloud reclind upon his airy throne and answerd thus.\n\n      Then if thou art the food of worms, O virgin of the skies,\n      How great thy use, how great thy blessing, every thing that lives.\n      Lives not alone nor or itself: fear not and I will call,\n      The weak worm from its lowly bed, and thou shalt hear its voice.\n      Come forth worm and the silent valley, to thy pensive queen.\n\n      The helpless worm arose and sat upon the Lillys leaf,\n      And the bright Cloud saild on, to find his partner in the vale.\n\n\n      III.\n\n      Then Thel astonish'd view'd the Worm upon its dewy bed.\n\n      Art thou a Worm?  image of weakness,  art thou but a Worm?\n      I see thee like an infant wrapped in the Lillys leaf;\n      Ah weep not little voice, thou can'st not speak, but thou can'st weep:\n      Is this a Worm?  I see they lay helpless & naked: weeping\n      And none to answer, none to cherish thee with mothers smiles.\n\n      The Clod of Clay heard the Worms voice & rais'd her pitying head:\n      She bowd over the weeping infant, and her life exhald\n      In milky fondness, then on Thel she fix'd her humble eyes;\n\n      O beauty of the vales of Har, we live not for ourselves,\n      Thou seest me the meanest thing, and so I am indeed:\n      My bosom of itself is cold, and of itself is dark,\n\n      But he that loves the lowly, pours his oil upon my head\n      And kisses me, and binds his nuptial bands around my breast.\n      And says; Thou mother of my children, I have loved thee\n      And I have given thee a crown that none can take away.\n      But how this is sweet maid, I know not, and I cannot know\n      I ponder, and I cannot ponder; yet I live and love.\n\n      The daughter of beauty wip'd her pitying tears with her white veil,\n      And said, Alas!  I knew not this, and therefore did I weep:\n      That God would love a Worm I knew, and punish the evil foot\n      That wilful bruis'd its helpless form: but that he cherish'd it\n      With milk and oil I never knew, and therefore did I weep,\n      And I complaind in the mild air, because I fade away.\n      And lay me down in thy cold bed, and leave my shining lot.\n\n      Queen of the vales, the matron Clay answered: I heard thy sighs.\n      And all thy moans flew o'er my roof, but I have call'd them down:\n      Wilt thou O Queen enter my house, tis given thee to enter,\n      And to return: fear nothing, enter with thy virgin feet.\n\n\n      IV.\n\n      The eternal gates terrific porter lifted the northern bar:\n      Thel enter'd in & saw the secrets of the land unknown;\n      She saw the couches of the dead, & where the fibrous roots\n      Of every heart on earth infixes deep its restless twists:\n      A land of sorrows & of tears where never smile was seen.\n\n      She wandered in the land of clouds thro' valleys dark, listning\n      Dolors & lamentations: waiting oft beside the dewy grave\n      She stood in silence, listning to the voices of the ground,\n      Till to her own grave plot she came, & there she sat down.\n      And heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit.\n\n      Why cannot the Ear be closed to its own destruction?\n      Or the glistening Eye to the poison of a smile!\n      Why are Eyelids stord with arrows ready drawn,\n      Where a thousand fighting men in ambush lie!\n      Or an Eye of gifts & graces showring fruits & coined gold!\n\n      Why a Tongue impress'd with honey from every wind?\n      Why an Ear, a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in?\n      Why a Nostril wide inhaling terror trembling & affright\n      Why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy?\n      Why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire?\n\n      The Virgin started from her seat, & with a shriek,\n      Fled back unhinderd till she came into the vales of Har.", "THE ARGUMENT": "        Rintrah roars and shakes his fires in the burden'd air,\n        Hungry clouds swag on the deep.\n\n        Once meek, and in a perilous path\n        The just man kept his course along\n        The Vale of Death.\n        Roses are planted where thorns grow,\n        And on the barren heath\n        Sing the honey bees.\n\n        Then the perilous path was planted,\n        And a river and a spring\n        On every cliff and tomb;\n        And on the bleached bones\n        Red clay brought forth:\n        Till the villain left the paths of ease\n        To walk in perilous paths, and drive\n        The just man into barren climes.\n\n        Now the sneaking serpent walks\n        In mild humility;\n        And the just man rages in the wilds\n        Where lions roam.\n\n        Rintrah roars and shakes his fires in the burden'd air,\n        Hungry clouds swag on the deep.", "THE VOICE OF THE DEVIL": "    All Bibles or sacred codes have been the cause of the following\n    errors:--\n\n    1. That man has two real existing principles, viz., a Body and a Soul.\n\n    2. That Energy, called Evil, is alone from the Body; and that Reason,\n    called Good, is alone from the Soul.\n\n    3. That God will torment man in Eternity for following his Energies.\n\n    But the following contraries to these are true:--\n\n    1. Man has no Body distinct from his Soul. For that called Body is a\n    portion of Soul discerned by the five senses, the chief inlets of Soul\n    in this age.\n\n    2. Energy is the only life, and is from the Body; and Reason is the\n    bound or outward circumference of Energy.\n\n    3. Energy is Eternal Delight.\n\n    Those who restrain desire, do so because theirs is weak enough to be\n    restrained; and the restrainer or reason usurps its place and governs\n    the unwilling.\n\n    And being restrained, it by degrees becomes passive, till it is only\n    the shadow of desire.\n\n    The history of this is written in Paradise Lost, and the Governor or\n    Reason is called Messiah.\n\n    And the original Archangel or possessor of the command of the heavenly\n    host is called the Devil, or Satan, and his children are called Sin and\n    Death.\n\n    But in the book of Job, Milton's Messiah is called Satan.\n\n    For this history has been adopted by both parties.\n\n    It indeed appeared to Reason as if desire was cast out, but the\n    Devil's account is, that the Messiah fell, and formed a heaven of what\n    he stole from the abyss.\n\n    This is shown in the Gospel, where he prays to the Father to send the\n    Comforter or desire that Reason may have ideas to build on, the Jehovah\n    of the Bible being no other than he who dwells in flaming fire. Know\n    that after Christ's death he became Jehovah.\n\n    But in Milton, the Father is Destiny, the Son a ratio of the five\n    senses, and the Holy Ghost vacuum!", "A MEMORABLE FANCY": "    As I was walking among the fires of Hell, delighted with the enjoyments\n    of Genius, which to Angels look like torment and insanity, I collected\n    some of their proverbs, thinking that as the sayings used in a nation\n    mark its character, so the proverbs of Hell show the nature of infernal\n    wisdom better than any description of buildings or garments.\n\n    When I came home, on the abyss of the five senses, where a flat-sided\n    steep frowns over the present world, I saw a mighty Devil folded in\n    black clouds hovering on the sides of the rock; with corroding fires\n    he wrote the following sentence now perceived by the minds of men, and\n    read by them on earth:--\n\n        _\"How do you know but every bird\n            that cuts the airy way\n        Is an immense world of delight,\n            closed by your senses five?\"_", "PROVERBS OF HELL": "    In seed-time learn, in harvest teach, in winter enjoy.\n\n    Drive your cart and your plough over the bones of the dead.\n\n    The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.\n\n    Prudence is a rich ugly old maid courted by Incapacity.\n\n    He who desires, but acts not, breeds pestilence.\n\n    The cut worm forgives the plough.\n\n    Dip him in the river who loves water.\n\n    A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees.\n\n    He whose face gives no light shall never become a star.\n\n    Eternity is in love with the productions of time.\n\n    The busy bee has no time for sorrow.\n\n    The hours of folly are measured by the clock, but of wisdom no clock\n    can measure.\n\n    All wholesome food is caught without a net or a trap.\n\n    Bring out number, weight, and measure in a year of dearth.\n\n    No bird soars too high if he soars with his own wings.\n\n    A dead body revenges not injuries.\n\n    The most sublime act is to set another before you.\n\n    If the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise.\n\n    Folly is the cloak of knavery.\n\n    Shame is Pride's cloak.\n\n    Prisons are built with stones of law, brothels with bricks of religion.\n\n    The pride of the peacock is the glory of God.\n\n    The lust of the goat is the bounty of God.\n\n    The wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God.\n\n    The nakedness of woman is the work of God.\n\n    Excess of sorrow laughs, excess of joy weeps.\n\n    The roaring of lions, the howling of wolves, the raging of the stormy\n    sea, and the destructive sword, are portions of Eternity too great for\n    the eye of man.\n\n    The fox condemns the trap, not himself.\n\n    Joys impregnate, sorrows bring forth.\n\n    Let man wear the fell of the lion, woman the fleece of the sheep.\n\n    The bird a nest, the spider a web, man friendship.\n\n    The selfish smiling fool and the sullen frowning fool shall be both\n    thought wise that they may be a rod.\n\n    What is now proved was once only imagined.\n\n    The rat, the mouse, the fox, the rabbit watch the roots; the lion, the\n    tiger, the horse, the elephant watch the fruits.\n\n    The cistern contains, the fountain overflows.\n\n    One thought fills immensity.\n\n    Always be ready to speak your mind, and a base man will avoid you.\n\n    Everything possible to be believed is an image of truth.\n\n    The eagle never lost so much time as when he submitted to learn of the\n    crow.\n\n    The fox provides for himself, but God provides for the lion.\n\n    Think in the morning, act in the noon, eat in the evening, sleep in the\n    night.\n\n    He who has suffered you to impose on him knows you.\n\n    As the plough follows words, so God rewards prayers.\n\n    The tigers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction.\n\n    Expect poison from the standing water.\n\n    You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.\n\n    Listen to the fool's reproach; it is a kingly title.\n\n    The eyes of fire, the nostrils of air, the mouth of water, the beard\n    of earth.\n\n    The weak in courage is strong in cunning.\n\n    The apple tree never asks the beech how he shall grow, nor the lion the\n    horse how he shall take his prey.\n\n    The thankful receiver bears a plentiful harvest.\n\n    If others had not been foolish we should have been so.\n\n    The soul of sweet delight can never be defiled.\n\n    When thou seest an eagle, thou seest a portion of Genius.
